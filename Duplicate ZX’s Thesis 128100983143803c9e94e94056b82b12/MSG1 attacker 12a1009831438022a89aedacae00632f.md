### Overview of the Attack

The "Generate Msg1 Attacker" is a technique in 5G networks where an attacker sends **multiple preambles** during the Random Access Channel (RACH) process to cause collisions with legitimate User Equipment (UE). This approach aims to interfere with regular network operations, particularly affecting Msg1 (the RACH preamble) in the four-step random access procedure.

### Key Concepts

1. **RACH Occasions (RO)**: Defined intervals where UE can send Msg1. Each RO is associated with specific Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) and preamble formats.
2. **SSB and RACH Relationship**: SSBs are mapped to RACH resources, with preamble length and format determined by `prach_ConfigurationIndex` and `prach_msg1_FDM` parameters.
3. **Relevant Parameters**:
    - **prach_ConfigurationIndex**: Controls PRACH time-domain configuration.
    - **prach_msg1_FDM**: Defines the number of ROs in the frequency domain.
    - **ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB**: Number of preambles per SSB.

### Steps in Attack Implementation

1. **Blocking Msg2 Reception**
    - **Objective**: Ignore Msg2 response (RAR) and subsequent network communication.
    - **Implementation**: Modify the MAC layer’s `nr_ue_dl_processing` function to prevent RAR and DLSCH data reception, allowing repeated Msg1 transmissions without processing subsequent messages.
2. **Triggering Repeated Msg1 Transmission**
    - **Objective**: Ensure Msg1 is sent frequently by the attacker UE.
    - **Implementation**: Modify the PRACH scheduler by adjusting conditions within `nr_ue_ul_scheduler` and `nr_ue_get_rach`. By bypassing specific conditions, the scheduler repeatedly triggers Msg1, simulating multiple ROs and increasing chances of collision with legitimate UE.

### Experimental Setup

- Testing configurations involved setups with both OpenAirInterface (OAI) components and commercial systems, including combinations like OAI UE with LiteOn RU and OAI gNB, coupled with Open5GS for core functionality.

### Results and Improvements

- Initial tests showed successful preamble transmission every two frames. Further optimization is possible to increase frequency, enhancing the attack's effectiveness.

This setup demonstrates the vulnerability of 5G RACH to preamble collisions and emphasizes the importance of robust authentication and anti-jamming mechanisms in network protocol design.
