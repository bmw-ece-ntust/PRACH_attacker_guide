## Summary of Generate Msg 3 Attack Method

<aside>

On the UE attacker side, we block the **PHY** from transmitting MSG1 (Preamble), but **MAC** still allocates PRACH resources and waits to receive the RAR (MSG2). Each time the COST UE sends MSG1 (Preamble), the UE attacker simultaneously receives the RAR (MSG2) sent by the gNB and sends a scrambled MSG3 payload to interfere with the COST UE's RRC connection, achieving the intended attack effect.

</aside>

### Attack Overview

The Generate Msg 3 attack is a method targeting the random access procedure in 5G networks. The attacker interferes with normal network connection processes by monitoring and responding to other UEs' random access procedures, particularly Msg2 (RAR) and Msg3.

### Attack Steps

<aside>

1. Prevent PRACH transmission: Modify the `nr_ue_prach_scheduler` function to prevent the attacker from sending actual PRACH while still listening for RAR. (Don't send MSG1; keep listening for RAR while waiting for COST UE to send MSG1)
2. Receive RAR messages from different slots: **Alter the RAR reception logic** to allow the attacker to process RAR messages not intended for itself.
3. Block Msg4 reception: Modify the `nr_Msg3_transmitted` function so that after sending Msg3, the attacker **restarts the random access process instead of waiting for Msg4.**
4. Prevent PRACH **sending**: Modify the `generate_nr_prach` function to allow the attacker to obtain RA-RNTI at the MAC layer **without sending PRACH at the PHY layer.**
5. ~~Increase RA window count: Modify the `nr_get_RA_window` function to expand the time window for receiving RAR.~~
6. Modify Msg3 content: In the `nr_ulsch_encoding` function, change the content of Msg3 to **random data**, all zeros, or all ones.
7. Enlarge the maximum number of **RACH attempts** to prevent attacker interruptions caused by preamble limit.
</aside>

### Attack Effects

Experimental results show that under normal conditions without attack, the number of Contention Resolution (CR) failures for a regular UE is 0. Under attack, the average number of CR failures increases to 4.7, requiring the UE to retransmit the preamble at least 4 times to successfully connect.

### Conclusion

The Generate Msg 3 attack effectively disrupts the random access process in 5G networks, increasing the connection failure rate and delay for legitimate UEs. This attack method reveals potential vulnerabilities in the 5G RACH process, emphasizing the importance of strengthening authentication and anti-interference mechanisms in network protocol design.
